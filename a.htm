                <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could not fault the effort of his players as Manchester United fell to a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night.</p>
                <p>Two second-half goals from Bernardo Silva and Leroy Sane were enough for the Blues to leave Old Trafford with three points, although the Reds rallied in the first half after a disappointing performance on Easter Sunday against Everton.</p>

                <p>It had been more than two years since Michael Caputo, the onetime campaign communications adviser to Donald Trump, had spoken to the man he helped elect president. It was a span that encompassed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, a probe with which Caputo had cooperated.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday, after the prolonged silence, Trump summoned Caputo to the White House for a reunion. So with his family in tow, Caputo met with the President and first lady in the Oval Office -- a warm reception that appears a distant cry from Trump's fury at other former aides who participated in the probe.</p>
